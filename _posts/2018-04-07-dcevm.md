title: Saving Roundtrips With HotSwapAgent and DCEVM
---

<img src="http://wiremock.org/images/wiremock-concept-icon-01.png" style="float:right;"/> Web development in Java can sometimes be burdensome. Because Java is not an interpreted programming language you have to compile the application, deploy it in an application server and then test it. This is known as the change -> compile -> deploy -> test -> repeat cycle. This article shows you a way to improve this cycle significantly. I am using Netbeans as IDE and Glassfish as runtime container. But this aproach can be adapted to other development environments, too.

-javaagent:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/lib/ext/hotswap-agent.jar
