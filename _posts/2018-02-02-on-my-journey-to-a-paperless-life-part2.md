title: On My Journey To A Paperless Life Part II: Backup
---
In my post about [My Journey To A Paperless Life](https://bmehner.github.io/on-my-journey-to-a-paperless-life/) I wrote about how I digitalize all my documents. The initial intention of this was to have a copy of everything important document outside our house. The blog post ends with the sentence "And of course the most important thing: Backing up these documents in the cloud is now a no-brainer." But is it really a no-brainer? Yes and no.

After I started to scan every document and make them searchable with the help of OCR the amount of scanned files increased rapidly. I began to think about the backup part of my journey to a paperless life. I came up with a bunch of requirements:

1. **Out of the house**: The backup should survive our house burning down, being flooded or other elementary dangers. Collective hardware crashes due to voltage peaks caused by lightning or similar events should also be covered.

1. **Cost effective**: Cost should be below 10â‚¬/month.

1. **Automated and regular**: I do not want to think about it. I want it to be one thing less I have to care about.

1. **Encrypted**: If I want to backup all important documents then this includes some fairly sensitive stuff: data on salary and taxes, account statements, insurance policies, pictures of my family and so on. So strong encryption is a must for the desired solution.

1. **Everything in one place**: If the shit hits the fan and all data at home is lost some how I need fast access to the data. So it is not suitable to spread the data over different storages.

1. **Big Enough to store 250GB of data**: Everything should be safe which is not easily reproducable. This includes all fotos and videos.

1. **Backup to the cloud but no always-on backup**: I want it out of the house. So basically every cloud storage like dropbox could do the trick. Unfortunately this does not protect you from Ransomware. The Ransomware would also encrypt the data in the cloud storage. Many cloud providers give you the possibility to activate a backup / versioning of your files in the cloud. But this doubles the amount of cloud storage needed which rises costs.
